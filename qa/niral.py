Net income links to both the balance sheet and cash flow statement.  In terms of the balance sheet, net income flows into stockholder’s equity via retained earnings.  Retained earnings is equal to the previous period’s retained earnings plus net income from this period less dividends from this period.  In terms of the cash flow statement, net income is the first line as it is used to calculate cash flows from operations.  Also, any non-cash expenses or non-cash income from the income statement (i.e., depreciation and amortization) flow into the cash flow statement and adjust net income to arrive at cash flow from operations. Any balance sheet items that have a cash impact (i.e., working capital, financing, PP&E, etc.) are linked to the cash flow statement since it is either a source or use of cash.

Assume 5% annual interest rate on debt, no principal pay down for the 1st year, straight-line depreciation, useful life of 5 years, and no residual value." , "If the company issues $100mm of debt, assets (cash) goes up by $100mm and liabilities (debt) goes up by $100mm.  Since the company is using some of the proceeds to buy machinery, there is actually a second transaction that will not affect the total amount of assets.  $50mm of cash will be used to buy $50mm of PPE; thus, we are using one asset to buy another one.  This is what happens when the company first buys the machinery.Because we have issued $100mm of debt, which is a contractual obligation, and because we are not paying down any part of the principal, we must pay interest expense on the entire $100mm.  So, in year 1 we must record corresponding interest expense which is the interest rate times the principal balance.  Interest expense for the 1st year is $5mm ($100mm * 5%).  And, since we now have $50mm of new machinery, we must record depreciation expense (as required by matching principle) for use of the machinery.  Since the problem specifies straight-line depreciation, useful life of 5 years, and no residual value, depreciation expense is $10mm (50/5).  Both interest expense and depreciation expense provide tax shields of $5mm and $10mm, respectively, and will ultimately reduce the amount of taxable income.") ,("Why is the cash flow statement important and how does it compare to the income statement?" , "The income statement shows a company’s accounting-based profitability.  It illustrates a company’s revenues, expenses, and net income.  Income statement accounting uses what is called accrual accounting.  Accrual accounting requires that businesses record revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.  Under accrual method, revenues are recognized when earned – not necessarily when cash is received – while expenses are matched to associated revenue – again not necessarily when cash goes out the door. The benefit of the accrual method is that it strives to show a more accurate picture of the companies profitability.  However, focusing on accrual based profitability without looking at cash inflows and outflows is very dangerous, not only because companies can more easily manipulate accounting profits than they can cash profits, but also because not having a handle on cash can potentially make even a healthy company go bankrupt.Those shortcomings are addressed by focusing on the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement identifies all of the cash inflows and outflows of a business over a certain period of time.  The statement utilizes cash accounting.    Cash accounting is the system used to keep track of actual cash inflows and outflows.  What this really means is that since not all transactions are made with cash (i.e., accounts receivable), such transactions would be backed out of the cash flow statement. Cash accounting literally tracks the cash coming into and out of the business.  One final point on cash vs. accrual accounting is that the differences between the two accounting systems are temporary timing differences that will eventually converge.      The key to financial analysis is to use both statements together.  In other words, if you have incredibly high net income, such net income should be supported by strong cash flow from operations and vice versa.  If this is not the case then you need to investigate why such a discrepancy exists.")), \
